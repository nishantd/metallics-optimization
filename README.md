# The hackathon

- Each team must produce recipes for the production schedule of heats (given in data/production_schedule.json).

- The final output must be in the same format as given in data/final_output_example.json. The fields are self explanatory.

- The only data available is in the data directory as described in data/README. Please read this file carefully.

- Optimization for the recipes:
  - The only thing being optimized for is scrap cost. We assume there are no other costs.

### Constraints:
- See constraints/constraints.json. They are self-explanatory and minimal.

### Copper model:
The only tramp element being measured and specified in the production schedule is Copper (cu). The only data you have to create a copper model is the history of previous heats (data/previous_heats_with_properties.json). (See data/README.md for more.)

## Rules

- No existing Noodle or SMS code can be used. Assume everything in this repo is public.

- Each team must create a branch with your team name (i.e. team-funny-geeks) and have everything checked into there.

- There must be a file generate_recipes.py that can be run with a single parameter (the name of the scrap_inventoryX.json file) and should output on stdout valid json for the schedule with recipes (see data/final_output_example.json). For example
```
python generate_recipes.py data/scrap_inventory1.json > 1_results.json
```
Should result in a valid scrap recipe schedule in 1_results.json.

- Work with your teams not across teams (i.e. within Noodle or SMS) for the duration of the hackathon in the spirit of the hackathon.

- You can use any public libraries and tools. They should be pip installable (add them to your requirements.txt).


## Helpful suggestions

- Make any assumptions you want in the interests of getting something done. If you can't get something done, create the simplest (or simplistic) solution, document it as 'to be improved' and move on. If something is not clear, add your assumptions and move forward.

- Create a virtual environment and keep a requirements.txt file so everyone in your team can run the code.

- Work from the outside in. Get something working end to end with the API / function calls and function signatures first (mock the data) and then work on implementation.

- Any schedule with recipes is better than no schedule.
